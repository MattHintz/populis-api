"""SQLite-backed vault registry storage.

Purpose-built persistence for ``VaultRegistry``.  Not a generic key-value
store — this module knows about the vault schema directly, which keeps
the abstraction surface narrow and lets the schema enforce invariants
the application would otherwise have to police in Python.

Why SQLite + WAL instead of a JSON file:

  * **Concurrency**: WAL mode (``PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL``) lets readers
    proceed in parallel with a single writer.  No global mutex; no
    poll-spin lock files; no head-of-line blocking when one request is
    mid-write.
  * **I/O scaling**: an UPDATE rewrites only the changed pages.  With
    10 000 registered vaults a single update touches ≈ 4 KB of disk;
    the equivalent JSON-file approach rewrites the entire file
    (potentially megabytes) on every change.
  * **Indexed reverse lookup**: ``by_evm`` is a real B-tree index;
    lookup is O(log N) regardless of registry size.  A JSON dict needs
    a parallel reverse index that the application has to keep in sync,
    introducing a class of consistency bugs we sidestep entirely.
  * **Crash safety**: WAL replay on open reconstructs any in-flight
    transaction.  No corrupt-file recovery branch needed; SQLite handles
    torn writes, kernel panics, and full-disk events at the storage
    layer.
  * **Schema versioning**: ``PRAGMA user_version`` plus an in-module
    migration table makes future changes routine instead of risky.
  * **Foreign data**: pure stdlib (``sqlite3``) — zero new dependencies.

Concurrency model
-----------------
A single ``VaultStore`` instance serializes its own writes via the
internal ``threading.Lock`` (because ``sqlite3.Connection`` objects
themselves aren't thread-safe by default).  Cross-process writers
serialize via SQLite's own file locking, which uses ``fcntl`` /
``LockFileEx`` rather than a sidecar lock file.  Cross-process readers
never block.

For the FastAPI use case (single-process async event loop) the
threading lock is uncontended; it's defensive cover for tests and for
future multi-worker deployments.

    Open one instance per process.  ``close()`` is idempotent and

    Args:
        path: filesystem path to the database file.  Parent directories
            are created if missing.  The special value ``":memory:"``
            yields an in-process ephemeral database (useful for tests).
        timeout: ``sqlite3.connect(timeout=...)`` — how long the

            volume.

    Thread safety:

        a re-entrant lock around every public method serializes access
        to the underlying connection.  For asyncio code this is a
